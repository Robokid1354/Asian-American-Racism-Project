        Pandemic-fueled rise in racism
      </a>
      <p>
        These are some of the stories revealed in a new youth-led study showing that one-quarter of Asian American young adults have been the targets of racism over the past year since the pandemic. The discrimination they detail primarily takes the form of verbal harassment, shunning and cyberbullying.

        1980s - Vincent Chin: A catalyst for the Asian-American civil rights movement
      </a>
      <p>
        Perhaps one of the most significant  events in the history of Asian American civil rights movement was the wrongful death of Vincent Chin in 1982. Two men blamed the “Japanese” for the US auto industry troubles. Ebens and Nitz beat Vincent Chin to death with a baseball bat. They were given a three year probation and never served a day of jail time. Leaders came together to form the American Citizens for Justice, and they lobbied on Chin’s behalf. Across the country people protested, rallied and fundraised.

        1970s - Asian Americans For Equality
      </a>
      <p>
        In the 1960s during the civil rights movement, Asian Americans saw how protesting could help their communities and began to protest along with black activists of that time. By protesting in New York in the early 1970s, the Chinese American community were able to get rights to be on a construction crew to build in Chinatown. A group called Asian Americans for Equality formed and organized protests based on what they had seen the African Americans do. The entire community participated, even non-asians.

        Asian Americans Then and Now - History of racism since the 1850s
      </a>
      <p>
        In the 1850s the Chinese immigrated to America and they were great cheap workers for the industrial revolution and westward expansion. They were recruited as contract labourers and railroad workers. These young men worked hard for long hours for very little pay. According to an article by the Asia Society, during the depression in 1870, many people lost their jobs. However in California 20% of the labor force jobs were taken by Chinese even though they represented only .002% of the entire US population. People resented the fact that while they didn’t have jobs, the Chinese were taking the jobs that could be theirs.

        The long history of racism against Asian Americans in the US
      </a>
      <p>
        In the face of rising anti-Asian racist actions – now at about 100 reported cases per day –  former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, implores Asian Americans to “wear red, white, and blue” in their efforts to combat the virus. Optimistically, before Donald Trump declared COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus,” Yang believed that “getting the virus under control” would rid this country of its anti-Asian racism. But Asian American history suggests a sobering reality.
